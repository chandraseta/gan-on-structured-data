    "Vanilla GAN is highly unstable and difficult to train. GAN is, however, easier to train than other generative models such as Boltzmann Machines since it does not require Monte Carlo approximations."

For example, in generating MNIST data, CGAN could produce dataset that represents the number 7 exclusively.\n",
